Programming, problem solving and breaking things down into smaller stapes. This will be don in iterations where you first have an overall solution
and then break things down into smaller and smaller steps until you are on a level where you understand each step that needs to be taken.

what do do you want,what would u like for your software to do? what problem it solve,automate,do?
- Define the problem
- the solution?
- solution breakdown
The 3 basic programming constructs
Sequence - the order in which instructions occur and are processed
Selection - determines which path a program takes when its running (refer to flowcharts)
Iteration - the repeated execution of a section of a code "block" when a program is running (loops)
Defenite iteration - count -controlled iteration (for loops)
Indefinite iteration - condition controlled iteration (while loops)
make sure to have returns
