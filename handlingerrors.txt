poor specification - if your not specific about what a program should do we are unlikely to examine the codes and make sure all cases are handled
Incomplete programs - During development there are obviopusly cases that we haven' yet taken care of thats unavoidable we must know when we have handled all cases
Unexpected arguments - Functions take arguments if a function is given  an argument we dont handle we have a problem.
Unexpected input - when a user inputs a character instead of an integer. or any input that tha program is not programmed for.
unexpected state - most programs keep a lot of data around for use what  if such data is incomplete.
Logical errors - code that simply doesn't do what it was supposed to do human errors usually unexpeted arguments in tandem, we just have to find and fix such problems.


NOTE: even a program compiles it doesnt it will run even so it will give inaccurate faulty results until you find the flaws in your logic.
compiler detects run time error mistypo wrong syntax,wrong arguments etccc. logic is harder to detect it is human side.
